## Ames Housing Price Prediction

![](/img/house.png)

This repository focuses on predicting the final prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using the Ames Housing dataset. The dataset comprises 79 explanatory variables that describe various aspects of these homes. The goal of this project is to develop a regression model capable of accurately predicting the sale prices of houses based on these features.

To address this regression problem, various machine learning techniques will be explored. This may involve preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and selecting suitable algorithms. The performance of different regression models will be assessed to determine the most effective approach for predicting house prices.

## Problem Definition
The challenge is to build a regression model that can predict the final sale price for each house in the dataset. For each Id in the test set, the model must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

## Dataset
The Ames Housing dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock for data science education, serves as a modernized and expanded alternative to the well-known Boston Housing dataset. It includes 79 features, providing a comprehensive view of residential properties in Ames, Iowa.
